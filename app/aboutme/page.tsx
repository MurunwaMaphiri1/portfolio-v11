                    cool UIs and backends,

                        I fell in love with tech at the age of 13 and since then I've never looked back.
                        From installing custom roms from xda developers to hacking games using Lucky Patcher, 
                        I was obsessed with figuring out how things worked behind the screen. 
                        That curiosity turned into a passion and it's what turned me into the person I am today. Itâ€™s what drives me to keep learning every day.

                    Currently, I&apos;m diving into Java and Next.JS
                    development, expanding my skills in these innovative areas.
